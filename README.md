## eSignature API

For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the eSignature API, see the [Required Scopes section](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/auth)

1. **Use embedded signing.**

## Installation
### Prerequisites
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 as they were automatically performed for you.

1. A free [DocuSign developer account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/); create one if you don't already have one.
1. A DocuSign app and integration key that is configured for authentication to use either [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) or [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).

   This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRI4fe5HgM) demonstrates how to obtain an integration key.  

   To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and a secret key. See [Installation steps](#installation-steps) for details.  

   To use [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and the API Username GUID of the impersonated user. See [Configure the launcher to use JWT Grant](#configure-the-launcher-to-use-jwt-grant) for details.  

   For both authentication flows:  
   
   If you use this launcher on your own workstation, the integration key must include a redirect URI of http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback.  

   If you host this launcher on a remote web server, set your redirect URI as:  
   
   {base_url}/authorization-code/callback   
   
   where {base_url} is the URL for the web app.  
   
1. PowerShell 5 or later


### Installation steps
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip step 3 as it was automatically performed for you.

1. Extract the Quickstart ZIP file or download or clone the code-examples-powershell repository.
1. In File Explorer, open your Quickstart folder or your code-examples-powershell folder.
1. To configure the launcher for [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) authentication, create a copy of the file config/settings.example.json and save the copy as config/settings.json.
   1. Add your integration key. On the [Apps and Keys](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=apiIntegratorKey) page, under **Apps and Integration Keys**, choose the app to use, then select **Actions** > **Edit**. Under **General Info**, copy the **Integration Key** GUID and save it in settings.json as your `INTEGRATION_KEY_AUTH_CODE`.
   1. Generate a secret key, if you donâ€™t already have one. Under **Authentication**, select **+ ADD SECRET KEY**. Copy the secret key and save it in settings.json as your `SECRET_KEY`.
   1. Add the launcherâ€™s redirect URI. Under **Additional settings**, select **+ ADD URI**, and set a redirect URI of http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback. Select **SAVE**.   
   1. Set a name and email for the signer. In settings.json, save an email address as `SIGNER_EMAIL` and a name as `SIGNER_NAME`.  
**Note:** Protect your personal information. Please make sure that settings.json will not be stored in your source code repository.
1. Run the launcher. In the root folder, right-click the **launcher** file and select **Run with PowerShell** > **Open**; then select an API when prompted in Windows PowerShell.
1. Select **Authorization Code Grant** when authenticating your account.
1. Select your desired code example.


### Configure the launcher to use JWT Grant

   1. Add your integration key. On the [Apps and Keys](https://admindemo.docusign.com/authenticate?goTo=apiIntegratorKey) page, under **Apps and Integration Keys**, choose the app to use, then select **Actions** > **Edit**. Under **General Info**, copy the **Integration Key** GUID and save it in settings.json as your `INTEGRATION_KEY_JWT`.
   1. Generate an RSA key pair, if you donâ€™t already have one. Under **Authentication**, select **+ GENERATE RSA**. Copy the private key and save it in a new file named config/private.key.
   1. Add the launcherâ€™s redirect URI. Under **Additional settings**, select **+ ADD URI**, and set a redirect URI of http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback. Select **SAVE**.   
   1. Set a name and email for the signer. In settings.json, save an email address as `SIGNER_EMAIL` and a name as `SIGNER_NAME`.  
**Note:** Protect your personal information. Please make sure that settings.json will not be stored in your source code repository.
1. Run the launcher. In the root folder, right-click the **launcher** file and select **Run with PowerShell** > **Open**; then select an API when prompted in Windows PowerShell.
